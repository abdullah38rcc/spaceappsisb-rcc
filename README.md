## RemoRoboCon (RRC) Overview

*RemoRoboCon (RRC) Aims to enhance tele-manipulators on the mobile service system (MSS) on the ISS, specifically the Dextre (SPDM). We seek to find ways to use wearable tech to improve precision and motion of control by adapting the robots to use data from wearable tech and voice.* 

This project is solving the SpaceGloVe: [Spacecraft Gesture and Voice Commanding challenge](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/spaceglove-spacecraft-gesture-and-voice-commanding/).

## Description
Telemanipulators on the ISS are very important and versatile robots. They are use in repair operations and reduce the risk to humans from space walks. One of the tele-manipulators is Dextre - the special purpose dexterous manipulator (SPDM). It is controlled currently by joy stick console system. We aim to let astronauts be able to do more by freeing their hands from controlling the joysticks and providing new ways of manipulating the robot arms.

We will simulate a simple, tele-manipulating robot with a rotating clamp claw in 2D on the iPad (top view). It will then be controlled by a hand-mounted wearable (iPhone) and use voice commands to activate rotation, extension. claw rotation and other commands. Motion sensors will be used to rotate, extend and orient the robot in the proper direction. This will greatly increase the dexterity of the astronaut as they do not have to hold the joysticks anymore.
